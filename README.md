## SAM Templates for Server-side Swift on AWS

This project contains a Cookiecutter template to create a serverless application based on the [AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-specification.html) and Swift.

This project is intended to be used as a template location for the [SAM Command Line Utility (CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html). SAM generates a project on your local machine based on this template.


``` text
You should not clone this project to use the SAM template. 

It is intended to be used as a target of the SAM CLI init command (see below).
```

## Using the Templates
